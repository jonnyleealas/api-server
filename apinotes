//first we received a request from the front end. this goes to our "server.js" file._id
  // our server.js file reads the address, and tries to find a handler for it
  // then it goes to categories.js, this handles our actual request. if its post, put, delete etc.
  // then it decides which function to call.
  // then it goes to categories-collections (or this file), and interacts with the DB.
  // then this file returns whatever needs to be returned.

  // step one is Server.js
  // step two is categories.js (in routes)
  // step three is categores-collections.js (in models)
  // step four is from categories-collections to categoires.js (routes)
  // step five is categoires.js (routes) to server js
  // step six is from server js to frontend.
  
  // this file is your middleware; this file goes between your category routes and the actual mongoDB

    // schema.findOne({"name": req.body.name})
    // findbyId <-- here all we need is the id of the record we are looking for.
    // scheum.findbyId({"_id": req.body.id OR just the id we are passing in})
